Install Apache2:
apt-get install apache2

Re install Apache2:
where is apache2
rm  /etc/apache(example)
sudo apt-get --purge remove apache2
sudo apt-get autoremove


Apache 2.4 config:

change the DocumentRoot path in 000-default.conf
change the Directory path in apache.conf

in apache.conf file directory syntax has to be there..
  <Directory /home/ladduz-05/Pictures >	
	  AllowOverride None
	  Require all granted
  </Directory>


Check the permissions on the directory. I would bet that it's set to deny access to anyone but yourself, for instance:

$ ls -ld /home/remix
drwx------ 92 remix remix 4096 Aug 17 22:59 /home/remix
If you see drwx------ exactly, then this is the case. Fix it by running:

chmod a+x /home/remix
(if its changes path will be in green color and for more reference  http://serverfault.com/questions/418101/apache-client-denied-by-server-configuration-despite-allowing-access-to-direc?rq=1)
